* `npm run build:scss` compiles the SCSS files located in the `src/scss/` directory into `dist`
* `npm run clean` deletes the `dist` directory to prepare for rebuilding the project

* `npm start` or `npm run start` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`
